Honeycode Snippets Library
======

In this library you will see illustrated useful patterns (UP), Key Concepts (KC) and Demonstration Labs (DL), and assets from past presentations. They are presented here to support your continued learning and success with Amazon Honeycode.

## Useful Patterns (UP)

Useful patterns, attempt to encapsulate one single recipe that you can use in many of your projects. It is more than an out of the box capability, and less than a full solution. You can use many patterns when you design apps, and even combine patterns for more amazing applications.

## Demonstration Labs (DL)

Demonstration labs are example solutions that you can try out in your Honeycode + AWS account. They will usually involve integrations or other complex logic, and may involve some coding. We strive to make each Demo Lab self sufficient, quick to execute (15-30 minutes), and demonstrate several capabilities.

## Presentations (PE)

Presentations section contains assets used in past presentations. Often these are slides with short descriptions, but can also include CSV files, resource links, or other assets used during the presentation.
